            <p><em>ABBA are a Swedish supergroup formed in Stockholm in 1972 by Agnetha Fältskog, Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. The group's name is an acronym of the first letters of their first names arranged as a palindrome.</em></p>
            <p><em>History</em></p>
            <p><em>All four ABBA members had local music careers before ABBA even formed. Frida and Agnetha were both solo singers. Benny and Bjorn both had their own individual bands. In 1966, Benny and Bjorn both met and decided to write songs together. In 1969, Bjorn met Agnetha and Benny met Frida. All four friends met together and decided to work together to record songs. By 1970, they were known as "Bjorn & Benny (With Svenska Flicka)". Later they were called Bjorn & Benny, Agnetha & Frida. Their first hit was a song called "Hej, gamle man". By 1971, Bjorn and Agnetha were married and Benny and Frida were engaged. "Ring Ring" in 1973 was when the group achieved success throughout much of Europe and Africa. It wasn't until 1973 that the group became officially known as ABBA. The name was suggested by their manager, Stig Anderson. In 1974, ABBA was given a chance to perform in the Eurovision Song Contest. With "Waterloo", they won and soon got global success. In 1976, ABBA released Dancing Queen, which is often known as ABBA's "signature song" and "one of the greatest pop songs ever written". During 1977, their huge popularity became known as "Abbamania". In Australia, ABBA played in huge concerts that usually always sold out. "ABBA: The Movie" was also released in 1977 during the height of the group's popularity. Throughout the mid and late 1970's ABBA performed in Europe, The United States, Japan and Australia. In early 1979, Agnetha and Bjorn divorced. In early 1981, Frida and Benny also got divorced. This led to many sadder and more mature songs over the next few years. By 1981, ABBA's popularity was declining. Their last album, "The Visitors" a not a big success like previous albums. The Day Before You Came was the last song ABBA ever recorded together, while Under Attack was the last song ever released, both in 1982. ABBA broke up shortly before 1983 and all members continued on their independent music careers, just like before they had met.</em></p>
            <p><em>Famous hit songs: Waterloo (1974) Mamma Mia (1975) Fernando (1976) Dancing Queen (1976) Money Money Money (1976) Take a Chance on Me (1977) Chiquitita (1978) Gimme Gimme Gimme (1979) The Winner Takes It All (1980)</em></p>

            <p><em>The Beatles - British rock group</em></p>

            <p><em>The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960, that comprised John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. They are regarded as the most influential band of all time and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form.</em></p>
            <p><em>History</em></p>
            <p><em>Starting in 1956, John Lennon and several of his friends played in a British band called the Quarrymen. Over the next few years, the members of the band changed, and by 1960, the band was called the Beatles. They did not have their first hit until 1962. In February 1963 their song, "Please Please Me", reached the number 1 position on the British charts. This was the first of a record 15 British number 1 singles. They first came to the United States in 1964. They were met at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City by thousands of screaming American teenagers. The Beatles were so popular that they were attacked by screaming fans everywhere they went around the world. The effect they had on their fans was known as 'Beatlemania'. The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show on 9 February 1964. About 74 million viewers—about half of the American population—watched the group perform on the show. Beatles songs soon filled the top 5 places on the American top 40 chart - a record that has never been matched.

            After the Beatles became so popular in the US, other British bands, such as The Rolling Stones, The Animals, The Kinks and Gerry and the Pacemakers had songs become hits there as well. So many British bands became popular after the Beatles' success that this time became known in America as the "British Invasion".

            Toward the mid-1960s, The Beatles became bolder with their style of music. This largely started in 1965, with the release of the album Rubber Soul, and hit a peak in 1967 with the release of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which was named as the greatest album of all time by Rolling Stone Magazine. They were also named the most influential artists of all time by Rolling Stone magazine, because their music, clothing style, and attitudes shaped much of what was popular among young people in the 1960s.

            The Beatles became so popular that no regular concert venue was big enough for their concerts. This led to them playing the first ever stadium rock concert at Shea Stadium in America, to around 50,000 people. The Beatles stopped touring and playing live music in 1966 because they were sick of audiences screaming so loudly that their music could not be heard. They were also tired of the pressures of touring. Among other things, they were so popular that thousands of people would gather outside the hotels they stayed in day and night meaning that they could never leave their rooms unless they were playing a concert.

            The Beatles broke up in 1970 because of the pressures of fame and each member becoming more independent both in their personal lives and musically.</em></p>
            <p><em>Since the remastering of the band's catalogue on CDs in the 1980s, the Beatles have a primary "core catalogue" of 14 albums:
            Please Please Me (1963) With the Beatles (1963) A Hard Day's Night (1964) Beatles for Sale (1964) Help! (1965) Rubber Soul (1965)
 Revolver (1966) Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) Magical Mystery Tour (1967) The Beatles ("The White Album", 1968) Yellow Submarine (1969) Abbey Road (1969) Let It Be (1970)</em></p>

            <p><em>Coldplay are a British rock band formed in London in 1997. They consist of vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, drummer Will Champion and creative director Phil Harvey.</em></p>
            <p><em>History</em></p>
            <p><em>Coldplay, is an English alternative rock band, formed in London in 1996-1997. Chris Martin, and Jonny Buckland, were looking forward to form a band while at University College London. After forming Pectoralz, Guy Berryman joined the group as the bass guitarist and they changed their name to Starfish. Will Champion joined as a drummer and backing vocalist who plays various instruments, making the band's lineup complete. Phil Harvey was the group's manager from 1998 to 2001. The band finally changed their name to "Coldplay" in 1998. Tim Rice-Oxley was to be added to the lineup, but he refused as he was already a member of Keane. The band later recorded. It was released on three EPs; Safety in 1998, Brothers & Sisters as a single in 1999 and The Blue Room in the same year. The Blue Room was their first release on a major record label, after signing to Parlophone.

            Coldplay's early material was compared to acts such as Radiohead, Jeff Buckley, U2, and Travis. They had achieved worldwide fame with the release of the single "Yellow" in 2000, followed by their debut album ''Parachutes'' released in the same year, which was nominated for the Mercury Prize. The band's second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), won multiple awards, including NME's Album of the Year. Their next release, X&Y, received a slightly less enthusiastic yet still generally positive reception upon its release in 2005. The band's fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), was produced by Brian Eno. It was released on again to largely favourable reviews, earning several Grammy nominations and wins.

            Since the release of Parachutes, Coldplay have drawn influence from other sources, including Echo & the Bunnymen, Kate Bush, George Harrison and Muse on A Rush of Blood to the Head, Johnny Cash and Kraftwerk for X&Y and Blur, Arcade Fire and My Bloody Valentine on Viva la Vida. Coldplay have been an active supporter of various social and political causes, such as Oxfam's Make Trade Fair campaign and Amnesty International. The group have also performed at various charity projects, such as Band Aid 20, Live 8, Sound Relief, Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief, and the Teenage Cancer Trust.</em></p>

            <p><em>History</em></p>
            <p><em>The band was started by Gerard Way after witnessing the September 11, 2001 attacks after he was on his way to work in New York and saw the bodies falling from the building. Gerard said that he thought to himself "What am I doing with my life? I'm slaving away doing drawings for Cartoon Network and not actually helping anybody". He then called up his friend Matt Pelissier who went on to recruit Ray Toro - the band's lead guitarist. Gerard said "there's nobody in New Jersey who can beat him, he is the best". Gerard's brother Mikey Way, bass guitarist, joined his brother's new band soon after.</em></p>

            <p><em>Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970 by Freddie Mercury, Brian May and Roger Taylor, later joined by John Deacon.</em></p>
            <p><em>History</em></p>
            <p><em>With his friend Tim Staffell, Brian May started a band called 1984 in the mid-1960s. The band broke up after a little bit and then May decided to make another band and teamed up with two other college students named Tim Staffell and Roger Taylor. They called themselves "Smile" with Roger Taylor on drums and vocals, Tim Staffell on vocals and bass and Brian May on guitar and vocals. They did a few hits such as "April Lady". Tim Staffell became friends with another college student, Farrokh Bulsara (to be later known as Freddie Mercury) and Farrokh became a big fan of Smile and encouraged them a lot. Later on, Tim left Smile to join Humpy Bongs and Farrokh Bulsara subsequently joined the band on vocals and piano in 1970. Then Farrokh came up with the name Queen, so they changed it from "Smile" to "Queen". They then started auditions for a new bassist. They were going through several bassists during this time and none of them stuck, only lasting for about a few minutes. None of the auditioners managed to suit the place of the new bassist, but finally in 1971, they settled on John Deacon. Queen's first album was released in 1973 and it was called Queen with songs such as "Seven Seas of Rhye" and "Liar". Farrokh Bulsara changed his name to Freddie Mercury after the lyrics "Mother Mercury, look what they've done to me" in "My Fairy King".</em></p>

            <p><em>The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. Active for over six decades, they are one of the most popular and enduring bands of the rock era. In the early 1960s, the Rolling Stones pioneered the gritty, rhythmically driven sound that came to define hard rock.</em></p>
            <p><em>History</em></p>
            <p><em>The band was initially formed by guitarist and harmonica player Brian Jones, pianist Ian Stewart, guitarist Keith Richards, vocalist Mick Jagger, drummer Tony Chapman, and bassist Dick Taylor. The lineup underwent some changes in the early years, with Charlie Watts replacing Tony Chapman on drums and Bill Wyman joining as the bassist.

            The Rolling Stones gained popularity during the 1960s as part of the British Invasion, a wave of British bands that achieved success in the United States. Their music was heavily influenced by American blues and rock 'n' roll, and they incorporated these elements into their own sound.

            In 1963, the band released their debut album, "The Rolling Stones," which featured mostly cover songs. They quickly followed it up with a string of successful albums, including "12 x 5" (1964), "Out of Our Heads" (1965), and "Aftermath" (1966). Their music resonated with audiences and they became known for their energetic performances and rebellious image.

            During the late 1960s and early 1970s, The Rolling Stones released several iconic albums, including "Beggars Banquet" (1968), "Let It Bleed" (1969), "Sticky Fingers" (1971), and "Exile on Main St." (1972). These albums featured hit songs such as "Sympathy for the Devil," "Gimme Shelter," "Brown Sugar," and "Tumbling Dice." The band's music during this period showcased a fusion of rock, blues, country, and other genres.

            Throughout their career, The Rolling Stones continued to tour extensively and release new music. They became known for their dynamic live performances, often breaking attendance records and creating a fan base that spanned generations.

            The band faced some challenges and setbacks over the years, including the untimely death of Brian Jones in 1969, but they persevered and continued to produce music. They experimented with different styles and genres, incorporating elements of funk, disco, and reggae into their sound.

            The Rolling Stones have achieved numerous milestones in their career. They have released over 30 studio albums, many of which have been critically acclaimed and commercially successful. Some of their most well-known songs include "Paint It Black," "Jumpin' Jack Flash," "Angie," "Start Me Up," and " (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction."

            In addition to their musical achievements, The Rolling Stones have made an indelible impact on popular culture. They have been influential in shaping the rock 'n' roll genre and have inspired countless musicians. Their iconic logo, the "tongue and lips," is one of the most recognizable symbols in music.</em></p>
